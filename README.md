# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code and content for my personal website. It serves as a central hub to showcase my portfolio, share my experiences, and connect with others.

# Development

I started this website in 2021 while learning how to use HTML and CSS. Although web development is not my strong suit, I was able to teach myself how to use it for my own purposes.

# Content

The main website is hosted in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The homepage_images folder has all the resources that the website uses. The example_websites folder holds ideas of website I came up with to showcase my skills.
